# Box

`Box` component is a versatile and flexible container that allows you to easily create and organize layout elements within your application.
It's designed to simplify the process of creating and managing layout elements, by providing a variety of props and styles that you can use to customize its appearance and behavior.

Think of it like a virtual box or container that you can place other components or elements inside.
Additionally, you can customize its appearance and behavior by setting properties like padding, borders, background color, and more.

Overall, the Box component is a powerful tool that makes it easy for developers to create and manage layout elements in their application.
By using it, you can streamline your development process and create more responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.

## Semantic elements

By default, Box renders a div element. You can customise this via the `as` prop. Props will also be forwarded to the underlying element.

```jsx
<Box as="a" href="#" target="_self" padding="4">
	This Box will act as HTML anchor
</Box>
```

## Dynamic CSS classes

The `className` prop is supported to handle any CSS side effects.

```jsx
<Box className="best-class-ever">...</Box>
```

## CSS utilities

Box provides a suite of common CSS utility props. Styles that regularly differ across screen sizes can also be expressed as responsive props, e.g. `justifyContent={{ mobile: 'center', tablet: 'flexStart' }}`.

These utilities are recommended where possible to reduce the amount of custom CSS in your application.

For the list of all properties check the `atoms.css.ts` file.

```jsx
<Box
	display="flex"
	justifyContent={{
		mobile: 'center',
		tablet: 'flex-start'
	}}
	borderRadius="medium"
	padding="4">
	...
</Box>
```

## Paddings and margins

Padding can be applied in all directions using tokens as values.

Margin is intentionally not supported to discurage developers from using it because of bad practices.

```jsx
<Box paddingX="2" paddingY="3">
	...
</Box>
```

## Responsive padding

Padding can also differ across screen sizes by providing responsive values, e.g. `padding={{ mobile: 'small', tablet: 'medium', desktop: 'large' }}`.

```jsx
<Box
	padding={{
		mobile: '2',
		tablet: '3',
		desktop: '4'
	}}>
	...
</Box>
```

## Colors and background

You can set background color and text color of the Box component using the `color` and `backgroundColor` props.

For the list of all colors check the `atoms.css.ts` file.

```jsx
<Box backgroundColor="primary.main" color="secondary.light">
	...
</Box>
```

If the background is not a simple color like gradients for example, use the following sythax:

```jsx
<Box background="gradient">...</Box>
```

## Shadows, borders and outlines

Box also provides `boxShadow`, `borderRadius`, `borderWidth`, `borderColor` properties. You can use them like this:

```jsx
<Box boxShadow="medium" borderRadius="medium" borderWidth="thick" borderColor="primary.dark" borderStyle="solid">
	...
</Box>
```
