# BlockIcon

A `BlockIcon` is a component that renders an SVG icon with a fixed size and a surrounding box. The size of the icon is determined by `size` prop.
BlockIcon is useful when you want to display an icon in a context where it needs to have a fixed size, such as a menu or a sidebar.

## Sizes

By default, all icons are large. To change the size pass the `size` prop with one of the following values:

- `small` - 16x16
- `medium` - 24x24
- `large` - 32x32

## Colors

To be able to change the color of SVGs, all assets must have `currentColor` set on the graphics.
Check the storybook examples for more details.

By default, color is inherited from the parent, however you can also change the color of the icon by passing `color` prop to the component.

## Usage

- All the assets must have bounding box when exported from Figma
- All the assets must have `currentColor` set for graphics

## Conclusion

In summary, `BlockIcon` and `InlineIcon` are two different components that can be used for working with icons on the frontend.
`BlockIcon` is useful when you want to display an icon with a fixed size and a surrounding box, while `InlineIcon` is useful when you want to integrate an icon with text or other elements.
By understanding the differences between these two components, developers can choose the appropriate one for their specific use case and create more effective and visually appealing user interfaces.
