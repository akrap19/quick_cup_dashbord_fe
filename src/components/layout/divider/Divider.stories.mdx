# Divider

The `Divider` component is a simple horizontal line that is used to visually separate content or elements on a web page.
It's commonly used to divide sections of a page, such as a header from the main content, or to separate groups of related content.

To add additional space above or below the Divider component, we can use the Stack component.

You can't customize color and width of the border. It's a hardcoded token value.
