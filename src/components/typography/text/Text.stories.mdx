# Text

The `Text` component is a components that provides a way to display text in a variety of styles and formats.
It includes options for text size, weight, color, alignment and more, as well as support for responsive design.

Overall, the `Text` component is a versatile and useful tool for creating clear and accessible text in a design system.

## Alignment

`Text` can be aligned via the `textAlign` prop. If you need alignment to differ across various screen sizes, you can provide responsive values describing the alignment of each breakpoint, e.g. `textAlign={{ mobile: 'center', tablet: 'left' }}`.

```jsx
<Text textAlign={{ mobile: 'center', tablet: 'left' }}>...</Text>
```

## Variants

There are 5 variants available for `Text` component.

- `bodytext` - default, use for body copy
- `h1` - heading level 1
- `h2` - heading level 2
- `h3` - heading level 3
- `h4` - heading level 4

By default `Text` component renders as HTML `p`. By passing `variant` prop to the component, it will still render as paragraph but will look like variant provided.

If you want to change the rendered element use the `as` prop.

If you want to render headings use the `Heading` component.

```jsx
<Text variant="bodytext">...</Text>
<Text variant="h1">...</Text>
<Text variant="h2">...</Text>
<Text variant="h3">...</Text>
<Text variant="h4">...</Text>
```

## Semantic elements

By default, `Text` renders a paragraph element. You can customise this via the `as` prop. Props will also be forwarded to the underlying element.

```jsx
<Text as="h1" variant="h1">
	This will render as HTML h1 element with appropriate heading styles.
</Text>
```

`Heading` component is made on top of `Text` like on the example above.

It exists to reduce the number of times the same props would be passed and to improve development experience and semantics.

### Other usages:

```jsx
<Text as="strong">This will render as HTML "strong" element.</Text>
<Text as="span">This will render as HTML "span" element.</Text>
<Text as="h5">This will render as HTML "h5" element.</Text>
```

## CSS utilities

`Text` provides a suite of common CSS utility props. Styles that regularly differ across screen sizes can also be expressed as responsive props, e.g. `fontSize={{ mobile: 'small', tablet: 'large' }}`.

These utilities are recommended where possible to reduce the amount of custom CSS in your application.

You can add following properties to `Text` component:

- `fontSize`
- `fontWeight`
- `lineHeight`
- `fontFamily`
- `textAlign`
- `color`
- `textTransform`
- `textDecoration`
- `fontStyle`
