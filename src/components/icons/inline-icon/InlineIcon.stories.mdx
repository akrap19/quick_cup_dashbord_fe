# InlineIcon

An `InlineIcon` is a component that renders an SVG icon inline with text or other elements. The size of the icon is determined by the font size of the parent element.
InlineIcon is useful when you want to integrate an icon with text or other elements, such as in a button or a link.
It allows you to align the icon with the baseline of the text and adjust the size of the icon based on the font size of the parent element.

## Size

All the icons have a fixed with of `0.75em`. To see the rationale behind that specific number check this documentation https://every-layout.dev/layouts/icon/.

## Colors

To be able to change the color of SVGs, all assets must have `currentColor` set on the graphics.
Check the storybook examples for more details.

By default, color is inherited from the parent, however you can also change the color of the icon by passing `color` prop to the component.

## Usage

- All the assets must **NOT** have bounding box when exported from Figma
- All the assets must have `currentColor` set for graphics

## Conclusion

In summary, `BlockIcon` and `InlineIcon` are two different components that can be used for working with icons on the frontend.
`BlockIcon` is useful when you want to display an icon with a fixed size and a surrounding box, while `InlineIcon` is useful when you want to integrate an icon with text or other elements.
By understanding the differences between these two components, developers can choose the appropriate one for their specific use case and create more effective and visually appealing user interfaces.
